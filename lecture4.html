					<section>
						<h2>New Institutionalism(s) </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Developed in 1980/90's in response to behavioural perspectives that dominated the 1960/70's. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Peter Hall and Rosemary Taylor sums up development and identify three different areas of research that is concerned with institutions. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Each of these have distinct answers to the following questions: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">What are institutions? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How does institutions relate to (individual) behaviour? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How and where do institutions origin? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How do institutions change and/or persist? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Historical Institutionalism </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Origins </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Conflict between groups for scarce resources at the heart of politics. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Influenced by structural functionalists: See polity as an overall system of interacting parts. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Comparative studies of public policies in different nations, focusing on impact of national political institutions. </li>
						</ul>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Definition of institutions </h2>
						<p class="fragment">"By and large, they define them as the formal or informal procedures, routines, norms and conventions embedded in the organizational structure of the polity or political economy." (p. 938) </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Focus on formal organisations, rules, and conventions. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Focus on assymmetrical power created by institutions. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Strong focus on path dependency and unintended consequences. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Often combine the influence of institutions with other explanaroty factors. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Relationship between institutions and individual behaviour. </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Historical institutionalists embrace several answers to this question. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Two overall approaches: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Calculus appraoch:</li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Instrumental and strategic calculation. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Institutions alter expectations that an actor has about the actions others are likely to take. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Thus institutions can provide more or less certainty about the present and futre. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Cultural approach: </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Individuals are deeply embedded in a world composed of symbols, scripts and routines. </li>
								<li class="fragment">These provide filters for interpretation of the world. </li>
								<li class="fragment">And this again affects how actors behave. </li>
							</ul>						
						</ul>
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Rational Choice Institutionalism </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Origins </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Rational-choice refers to theories that assume humans are rational beings. (very simplified) </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Inspired by puzzle about collective actions problems. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutions lower the transaction-costs of makings deals, to allow outcomes that would otherwise be irrational. </li>
						</ul>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Four characteristics: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Behavioural assumptions about fixed preferences. </li>
							<li class="fragment">See politics as a series of collective action dilemmas. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Emphasize the role of strategic interaction. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutions exists as voluntary agreements by individual actors. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The last point leads to a notion that insitutions only survive if they provide enough benefits to the relevant actors. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Sociological Institutionalism </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Origins </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Comes from organistional theory in sociology. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Reaction against earlier notion that organisations evolved to become more efficient over time. </p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>More broad definition of institutions:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">No distinction between organisational "institutional" explenations and cultural explenations. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Redifinition of "culture" as a network of symbols, routines, and scripts rather than individual values or attitudes. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Extreme focus on cultural approach:</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Institutions define... </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">..what is acceptable. </li>
							<li class="fragment">...but also what is even possible. </li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="fragment">...which leads to a mutually-constitutive relationship between insitutions and individual action. </li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Persistance of institutions </h2>
						<p class="fragment">A "logic of social appropiateness" instead of a "logic of appropriateness".</p>
						<p class="fragment">What is "legitimate" and "socially appropriate"?</p>
						<p class="fragment">A matter of cultural authority. </p>

						<h2>Puzzle to explain: </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Why did railway reform in UK and Germany turn out so differently?</p>
						<p class="fragment">Ie. which institutional differences between UK and Germany might explain the different policy outcomes? </p>
						<div style="float: left; width: 50%">
							<h2 class="fragment">Great Britain</h2>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">All parts of railway system privatised completely (ie. no public ownership) </li>
								<li class="fragment">Railway infrastructure -> one independeent private company. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Train services split into many smaller private companies (with franchising by public authorities)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div style="float: left; width: 50%">
							<h2 class="fragment">Germany </h2>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Vertical separation within new DB holding company (Infrastructure and train services in separate companies, but with shared owner). </li>
								<li class="fragment">DB holding company turned into private law company, but kept under public ownership. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Responsibility for local and regional rail delegated to Länder. </li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Theoretical framework: </h2>
						<p>Some possible institutional factors explaining differences: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Coercive pressures: Pressure by other organisations, which an organisation is dependent on. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Org. of political-administrative nexus: </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Administrative capacities <span class="fragment"><= different types of "on-the-job learning" (Dienstwissen)</span><span class="fragment"> <= typical career-paths of civil servants. ("lateral transfer vs. "pantouflage" vs. domain-specific expertise)</span></li>
								<li class="fragment">Dominant overarching deparments </li>
								<li class="fragment">Length of ministerial appointments (=> strength of ministers vs. bureaucracy) </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Access of societal actors: Different institutional setups allow diffferent interest groups access to the decision-making process.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Findings and conclusions</h2>	
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Coercive pressures: Played little role in both cases. 
								<ul>
									<li>EU regulation existed, but both cases went beyond requirements, and mainly used that to justify own positions. </li>
									<li>Experiences from other countries were either not seeked at all or rejected routinely. </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">Political-administrative nexus: Strong evidence of crucial impact. 
								<ul>
									<li>"Lateral transfer" of public servants with privatisation experience in UK vs. civil servants and experts from the railway domain in Ge. </li>
									<li>UK Treasury and weak UK government vs. many political veto points in Germany lead to more room for civil servants in UK to dominate. </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">Access of societal actors: Limited role, but some differences between cases: 
							<ul>
								<li>UK: BR cut off from process and potential future franchisees not included. </li>
								<li>Germany: DB, academics and unions directly involved in reform commission... but according to author only because they served the politically suported positions. </li>
							</ul>

						<h2>Puzzle to explain: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Liberalisation of German infrastructure, </li>
							<li class="fragment">which was previously very state dominated (either state-owned, state-run, or state licensed monopoly) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Substantial change of behaviour among market actors. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But strong continuity of regulatory patterns. </li>

						<p class="fragment">"Neo-institutionalism focuses on how institutional settings structure and shape political strategies, processes and outcomes." (p. 83) </p>

							<li class="fragment">Institution-based approaches (sociological and historical institutionalism) </li>
