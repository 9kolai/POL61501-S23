					<section>
						<p>Public policy can be defined as the broad strategy government uses to do its job. More formally, it is the relatively stable set of governmental behaviors that address matters of concern to some part of society. The purpose of public policy is to: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">guide legislative action that is more or less fixed for long periods of time, not just short-term fixes or single legislative acts </li>
							<li class="fragment">deal with issues of concern to some large segment of society, as opposed to matters of interest only to individuals or a small group of people</li>
							<li class="fragment">be more than just the actions of government; it also includes the behaviors or outcomes that government action creates. </li>

					<section>
						<h2>What is a Policy Cycle? </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A theoretical construction! </li>
							<li class="fragment">Prescriptive and normative rather than descriptive and analytical. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Attempts to split the process of policy formation into separate stages. </li>
							<li class="fragment">(and simoultaneously recognise that there is no real start and end to a policy process)</li>
							<li class="fragment">And thus serves a basic need to organise and systematise our understanding of this process. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But there are many opinions about which steps this process should be split into. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Examples of (theories of) the policy cycle: </h2>
						<ul style="float: left; width: 45%">
							<li class="fragment">Laswell (1956):
								<ol>
									<li>Intelligence </li>
									<li>Promotion </li>
									<li>Prescription </li>
									<li>Invocation </li>
									<li>Application </li>
									<li>Termination </li>
									<li>Appraisal </li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">In the following decades, many scholard developed even more detailed versions with several sub-stages. </li>
						</ul>
						<ul style="float: right; width: 45%">
							<li class="fragment">However, the main stages that has mostly been adopted in subsequent research are: 
								<ol>
									<li>Agenda-setting </li>
									<li>Policy formulation / analysis </li>
									<li>Decision making </li>
									<li>Implementation </li>
									<li>Evaluation </li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>But when is a policy finished? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">What does it indicate that it is a cycle? </p>
						<p class="fragment">Evolved as a critique of normative notions of ideal policy making as a linear process. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Instead the circular perspective sees policy making as a constantly evolving process. </p>
						<p class="fragment">A key part here is the notion of feedback loops: Policy implementations and evaluations create new insights that feed back into the understanding of the policy problem. </p>
						<p class="fragment">So Laswell's cyclical model has two implications for our understanding of policy making: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">It splits policy making into separate stages that can be studied individually. </li>
							<li class="fragment">It lets go of the notion that policies are the result of a clear linear process. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Instead of just comparing different institutions (as we did last week), this framework allow us to focus on (specific) processes. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>When does each stage begin and end? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Policy Cycle theories conceive policy making as a chronological order of processes. </p>
						<p class="fragment">But this should be understood as an ideal type, and not an accurate picture of real policy formation! </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Policy formation is messy and can jump between stages unpredictably. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The different stages tend to overlap each other in real life (policies are constantly reviewed, modified, and maybe even terminated at any point in the policy cycle). </li>
							<li class="fragment">Policies are not developed in vacuum (Hogwood and Peters, 1983). They are influenced and influences other policies that are subsequently developed/implemented/evaluated. </li>
							<li class="fragment">In addition to unintended consequences (which the feedback loop of a cycle model takes into account), policies also create new problems, that can cause new policies to emerge. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>So theories of policy cycles are inaccurate descriptions of policy formation. </p>
						<p class="fragment">...and for that reason does not work well as an analytical framework to predict policy outcomes. </p>
						<h2 class="fragment">But it allows us to focus our analysis on generic features of the policy process. </h2>
						<p class="fragment">As opposed to focussing on specific actors or institutions. </p>
						<p class="fragment">And this has resulted in useful theories and general findings about each of the policy stages. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Stages of a conventional policy cycle: </h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Agenda-setting </li>
							<li>Policy formulation / analysis </li>
							<li>Decision making </li>
							<li>Implementation </li>
							<li>Evaluation </li>
						</ol>

				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Agenda-setting </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>What is the "agenda"? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Kingdon's (1995) definition: </p>
						<p class="fragment">"...the list of subjects or problems to which government officials, and people outside the government closely associated with those officials, are payinng some serious attention to at any given time." </p>
						<p class="fragment">Government (insitutional) agenda <-> media and public agenda (systemic) </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>And how is this agenda set? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Assumption that not all problems can recieve the same level of (or any) attention. </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Recognition of problem </li>
							<li class="fragment">Take advantage of rising attention (for a variety of outside reasons) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Dramatising problems </li>
							<li class="fragment">Advancing particular definitions of problems/possible solutions. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Many actors involved, but outside control of any single actor. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Is this always true? </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p classs="fragment">Key is the move from recognition of problem to formal political agenda. </p>
						<h2 class="fragment">So are all problems recognised on the same conditions? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Does agenda reflect "real" severety of "real" issues? </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Outside-initiation (social actors gain public support) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">(Perhaps a democratic ideal for many) </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Inside-initiation (Lobbyinng with direct access to government officials) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">European agricultural policies. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Gvoernment mobilisations (top-down without relevant role for non-state actors) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">The introduction of the Euro. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Consolidation (state initiation of already popular issue) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">German unification. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">"Forced Choice situations" (could often be classified as outside-initiation)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Possible explanatory factors of agenda-setting: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Actors (who are engaging and how are they engaging?) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutions (what institutional context?)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Ideas </li>
							<li class="fragment">Material conditions </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">But how does these interact? </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Kingdon's multiple streams model </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Builds on garbage can model of organisational choice. </p>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Solutions </li>
							<li>Problems </li>
							<li>Actors </li>
							<li>Decision opportunities </li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="fragment">Windows of opportunity</h3>
						<p class="fragment">These open up when the following intersect: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Policy stream (solutions) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Politics stream (parliamentary composition, government, and public sentiment)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Problem stream (problem perception) </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				

				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Policy formation and decision making </h3>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Policy formation: Definition of objectives and consideration of alternative actions. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Decision-making: Formal decision to take specific action. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Often difficult to distinguish between these two in real life cases.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Improve government through rational decision-making and planning </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Popular idea in the 1950's and 1960's</li>
							<li class="fragment">Establishment of clearly defined goals -></li>
							<li class="fragment">Output targets within budgets -></li>
							<li class="fragment">Cost-benefit analysis to alternative policies. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Do you think this looks like a sensible approach to policy formation? (and decision-making?)</p>
						<p class="fragment">Do you think it looks like a realistic description of how the world really works? </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pluralism in policy-making </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Conflict between different interests!</li>
							<li class="fragment">Bargaining between diverse actors with different interests rather than rational seleciton among alternative policies. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Many actors and interests influences policy formation:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Minesterial departments (and sub units)</li>
								<li class="fragment">Political parties and parliamentary subcommitees</li>
								<li class="fragment">Organised interest groups</li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">Pluralist theories focus on many competing ideas with access to the process. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Corporatist policy-making</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Few associations with priveleged access to process.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Policy networks: </li>
							<li class="fragment">Non-hierarchical horizontal relationships between actors: But not all nodes are connected. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Basically, connections to policy formation process matter more than bargaining. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Advocacy coalitions: Sub-networks that compete for dominance over respective policy domains. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Historical-institutional policy-making </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Sees policy networks as a result of pre-existing (state-)structures and organistations</li>
							<li class="fragment">Specific history leads to "national styles of policy making": Preferred policy instiruments, and resources to rely on. </li>
							<li class="fragment">This can be contrasted to an idea of policy area-specific "issue-networks" </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Political decision-making </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Final adoption of public policy is usually more dominated by formal institutions, but other factors also play a role here: </li>
							<li class="fragment">Feasible options might be reduced because of limited resources (both economically and in terms of support)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Competencies of different actors in formal decision-making, in particular different veto-points:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Parliaments and second chambers</li>
								<li class="fragment">Constitutional courts </li>
								<li class="fragment">Individual states in federations </li>
								<li class="fragment">Facultative or constitutionally required referendums.</li>
							</ul>
