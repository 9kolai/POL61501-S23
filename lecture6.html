						<h2>Main changes to schedule: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Second lecture about public policy replaced with an additional week about the role of citizens in politics (and engineering). </li>
							<li class="fragment">This gives us an opportunity to go into a bit more depth on a theme that is central to democracy. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Last ordinary class adapted to focus more on practical applications of what you have learned. </li>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Cases for your case studies </h3>
					<section>
						<p>For your presentations (50% of final grade) and exam papers (50%), you will need to: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Find a case to analyse. </li>
							<li class="fragment">And use theories covered in class to answer some questions about your case. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">So it is a good idea to start thinking about cases you might be interested in. But what do we mean by cases?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is a case and what is it a case of? </h2>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Fundamentally, we can imagine two types of cases that would be relevant for your projects: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Regulations (with relevance to your field of engineering) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">A specific standard, rule, norm, or regulation. </li>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">Explain how and why this regulation was established. </li>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">...using theories from class to offer one or alternative explanations to this quesiton. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Engineering projects (where politics plays/played a significant role)</li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">Fx. public infrastructure projects, or private projects that require(d) political approval.</li>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">Or public policy decisions that affect engineering projects (fx. banning cars running on fossil fuel, or political support for specific engineering solutions such as carbon capture)</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Voting - most important type of political pariticpation? </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Voting in your home country </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Take a couple of minutes to find the answers to the following questions: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Who are allowed to vote in your country?</li>
							<li class="fragment">What was the turnout at the last general election in your home country?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Is this a fall or increase in turnout compared to previously? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Discussion </h2>
						<p>Do you think voting is an effective way to influence politics in your home country? </p>

						<h2>What is the purpose of citizen participation in a democracy? </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How can/do citizens participate in politics (other than voting)? </h2>

							<li class="fragment">Share and like political messages online </li>
							<li class="fragment">Civil disobedience </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Group work </h2>
						<p>For each type of political pariticpation discuss the following questions: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Is it expsensive? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Can it be done anywhere? At any time? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Can it be done alone or in groups?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Does it require special knowledge or information?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Does it require any special access?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Is it dangerous? </li>
							<li class="fragment">What might stop someone from engaging in this activity?</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Based on your discussions try to rank the methods of particiaption from least to most accessible. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Discussion</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Which factors might affect political participation? 
								<ul>
								<li>What are the main barriers to participation?</li>
								<li>What would be most important to encourage more particpation? (money, time, group support)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>							
							<li class="fragment">What do you think it means for democracy that/if participation is not equal?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Do you beleive political participation is important for democracy to function? Any type of participation?</li>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Citizen particiaption and engineering </h3>
					<section>
						<h2 class="fragment">Do you also think citizen participation is important in (some) engineering projects? </h2>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Which kind of projects? </li>
							<li>Why is it (not) important? </li>
							<li>How and when should citizens participate in engineering? </li>
