							<li class="fragment">Citizen-initiated </li>
							<li class="fragment">Government-initiated </li>

						<p class="fragment">Last week focussed mostly on citizen-initiated participation apart from voting. </p>
						<p class="fragment">But governments and public administrations invite citizens to participate in many other ways. </p>

					<section>
						<h2>What role should citizens play in political decision making? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Democracy: Demos (people) + kratos (rule) = Rule by the people. </p>
						<p class="fragment">So citizens obviously ought to play <em>some</em> role in democracies. </p>
						<p class="fragment">So this is fundamentally a question of what democracy is. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is democracy? </h2>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">A contested concept! </p>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">In fact, Jean-paul Gagnon identifes no less than 2234 distinct descriptions of democracy. </p>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" style="font-size:small">(Gagnon, J.-P., 2018. 2,234 Descriptions of Democracy: An Update to Democracy’s Ontological Pluralism. Democratic Theory 5, 92–113.)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A minimalist definition of democracy: </h2>
						<p class="fragment">People elect representatives in competitive elections to carry out their will. </p>
						<p class="fragment" style="font-size:small">Schumpeter, J.A., 1942. Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (inspired by Max Weber)</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">People are too ignorant and superficial to actually govern themselves. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Democracy as a competition between leaders (and their policies).</li>
							<li class="fragment">Importance of allowing leaders to rule when elected. </li>
							<li class="fragment">=> Very limited role for citizen participation beyond elections. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pluralist democracy and Polyarchy</h2>
						<p style="font-size:small">Dahl, R.A., 1956. A Preface to Democratic Theory  & Dahl, R.A., 1989. Democracy and its critics. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Five conditions for democracy (theoretical. According to Dahl no democracy perfectly meets all criteria):</p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Effective participation: Adequate and equal opportunity to form preferences. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Voting equality: One person, one vote </li>
							<li class="fragment">Enlightnened understanding: Opportunity for all to discover knowledge about choices. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Control of the agenda: Every citizens must have a say on what political matters are.  </li>
							<li class="fragment">Inclusiveness: Equal participation must extend to all citizens. </li>
						</ol>
						<p class="fragment">Polyarchies are imperfect democracies. All conditions are not met perfectly. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Citizen political engagement is more important, but citizen's key role is to elect elites. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Participatory democracy </h2>
						<p class="fragment">A very broad range of theories that all stress the importance of active citizen involvement in politics in a democracy. </p>
						<p class="fragment">These views acknowledge the importance of a strong civil society to uphold a libearl democracy. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Carole Pateman is a strong proponent of participatory democracy, who argues that citizen participation in politics has two important outcomes: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Policies that take all citizens into account. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Development of social and political capacities of individuals. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Ie. participation is a good in itself, that is required to create better citizens. </p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Deliberative democracy </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Democratic legitimacy comes from authentic deliberation, rather than voting! </p>
						<p class="fragment">The best argument should win, rather than the one with most support. </p>
						
						<p class="fragment">Some central authors: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Jürgen Habermas </li>
							<li class="fragment">John Rawls (and Joshua Cohen)</li>
							<li class="fragment">James Fishkin</li>
							<li class="fragment">John Dryzek</li>
							<li class="fragment">Jane Mansbridge</li>
							<li class="fragment">...and many more</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">According to many, this has become the dominant notion of democracy in political theory. </p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is authentic deliberation? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">A lot of different notions of this, but Habermas' communicative rationality is often used as a basis. Reason giving, justification of opinions, and open-minded-ness play a role here. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Amy Gutmann and Dennis F. Thompson have developed four practical requirements for the reasons given in a deliberative democracy: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Reciprocal: Acceptable reasons to free and equal persons. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Accessible: Reasons must be public (and understandable)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Binding: The process should lead to a binding decision. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Dynamic or Provisional: An openness to change one's mind and reconsider previous decisions. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is authentic deliberation? </h2>
						<p>Another example of concrete requirements to deliberation developed by James Fishkin and Robert Luskin: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Informed and informative: Based on (reasonable) factual claims. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Balanced: Arguments and counterarguments. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Conscientious: Willingness to listen as well as talk respectfully. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Substantive: Focus on substance of arguments and not performance. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Comprehensive: All relevant points and positions should be included. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The role of citizens in deliberative democracy</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Preferences are not determined a priori!</li>
							<li class="fragment">So preference formation is a central part of political engagement. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Process legitimacy rather than output legitimacy: Political outcomes are justified by the deliberative process rather than the quality of their outputs. </li>
							<li class="fragment">So the process of deliberation is crucial!</li>
							<li class="fragment">Different emphasis on citizen participation in deliberation. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Focus on inclusion of arguments, rather than inclusion of people. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Representativeness might be more important than quantity (according to some deliberative theorists)</li>
						</ul>

					<section>
						<h2>What are they? </h2>
						<p>Clodagh Harris' definition: </p>
						<p class="fragment">"...a democratic innovation<span class="fragment">, in which a sub-group of citizens (some of whome may be randomly or quasi-randomly selected)</span><span class="fragment"> engage with experts, witnesses, advocates, stakeholders and one another</span><span class="fragment">, in facilitated informed deliberations on a given matter</span><span class="fragment">, and publicly present their opinions and/or recommendations to their commissioning body and wider society."</span> (p. 47) </p>

						<h3>But the all share a general process involving: </h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">An information phase. </li>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Participatory Budgetting</h3>
					<section>
						<h2>What is it? </h2>
						<p>One definition (from Ganuza, Ernesto, and Gianpaolo Baiocchi. 2019. ‘The Long Journey of Participatory Budgeting’. In Handbook of Democratic Innovation and Governance): 
						<p class="fragment">...a sequence of meetings open to all, to discuss projects and priorities, followed by an open and transparant system for vote-taking to rank-order priorities, and then composing a budget reflecting voters' preferences." (p.83)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Main features </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Channel funding through PB, ie. delegate responsibility for economic priorities to citizens. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Meetings should be "open to all".</li>
							<li class="fragment">In this way it by-passes many traditional stakeholders (going from organised participation through civil society organisations to direct individual participation)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Binding decisions (contrary to most mini-publics). </li>
							<li class="fragment">In original version it was complemented by administrative decentralisation and permanent institutionalisation of PB events (this has often been watered down since though)</li>
						</ul>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Referenda and Citizens' Initiatives</h3>
					<section>
						<h2>What are they? </h2>
						<p>Ballot measures pertaining to individual issues, ie. not electing representatives, but direct citizen voting on individual decisions. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Citizens' Initiatives: When citizens can trigger a referendum on an issue (or to repeal a law) by gathered a certain number of signatures. </p>

						<h2>Case 1: Handling of nuclear waste </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A country has produced nuclear energy for many years. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The radioactive waste has been temporarily stored at the power plants until a long-term solution was found. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But now the first power plants will be decommissioned, so the nuclear waste needs to be removed. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The country needs to decide where and how to store the nuclear waste. And whether it needs to be another temporary or permanent solution. </li>
						</ul>
						<div class="fragment">
						<h2>Discussion </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Do you think the general public should have a say in this decision? </li>
							<li>How should/could citizen engagement be organised? </li>

						<h2>Case 2: Internet governance & ICANN </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Since 1998 the American non-profit org ICANN has managed the Internet's global Domain Name System. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Until 2016 this was done under a contract with the US government. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But when that ran out some argued that the UN agency ITU should take over control. </li>
							<li class="fragment">This was highly contested and some feared that it would lead to more political control of the Internet (including potential censorship/shut downs/or break with neutrality principles). </li>

						<h2>Case 3: Green transition of economy </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A country has signed the international Paris accord that aim to keep global warming below 1,5 degress. </li>
							<li class="fragment">This means that the country will have to reduce it's greenhouse gas emmissions drastically. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But there are many ways to reach the reduction targets. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The country needs to decide which emmissions to reduce by how much, when, and how. Different technical solutions and "emmission-free alternatives" also need to be chosen or prioritised for support/approval. </li>
