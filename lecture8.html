					<section>
						<h2>Intended learning outcomes </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Upon successful completion of this module, students will have acquired a fundamental understanding of basic political processes, as well as a selection of theoretical frameworks to analyse these processes. They will be able to apply different theoretical frameworks to explain why and how their own field of engineering is regulated the way it is, and analyse which political priorities and potential trade-off’s need to be taken into account when regulating such fields. 
Students will also have gained experience communicating basic analyses of political regulation both orally and in the form of a written report. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Assessment </h2>
						<p class="fragment">The module grade consist of a written term paper (50%) and an oral presentation during the seminar (50%). For this, students will pick a specific policy problem of their own choice and apply the theories covered in class to this case. Through the written paper, students will document to which extent they have gained a foundational understanding of democratic policymaking and whether they are able to apply theories and analyse specific policy problems. The accompanying presentation tests their communicative abilities to present a scientific topic to an audience.</p>

						<h2>Student presentations</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">21st July, 10.00-14.30 </li>
							<li class="fragment">Room: H.003 (ground floor of HfP)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Approx. 15min: 10min presentation + 5min discussion</li>
							<li class="fragment">Facilitate short discussion </li>
							<li class="fragment">Good idea to prepare some questions for discussion </li>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Cases for your case studies </h3>
					<section>
						<p>For your presentations (50% of final grade) and exam papers (50%), you will need to: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Find a case to analyse. </li>
							<li class="fragment">And use theories covered in class to answer some tasks about your case. </li>
							<li class="fragment">You can (but do not have to) use the same case for your presentation and paper. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Have you already started to think about a case for your presentation/paper?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is a case and what is it a case of? </h2>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">No formal requirements and case selection not part of assessment. <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">But important that you find a case with relevance to political decision-making to be able to answer tasks.</span></p>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Fundamentally, we can imagine two types of cases that would be relevant for your projects: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Regulations (with relevance to your field of engineering) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">A specific standard, rule, norm, or regulation. </li>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">Explain how and why this regulation was established. </li>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">...using theories from class to offer one or alternative explanations to this quesiton. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">Engineering projects (where politics plays/played a significant role)</li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9">Fx. public infrastructure projects, or private projects that require(d) political approval.</li>
								<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10">Or public policy decisions that affect engineering projects (fx. banning cars running on fossil fuel, or political support for specific engineering solutions such as carbon capture)</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Tasks for you case studies </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Choose one of two tasks! </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Once you have selected a case, your analysis of that case should address one of two tasks, that I will give you: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Explaining a political decision </li>
							<li class="fragment">Democracy and the role of Citizens in engineering </li>
						</ol>
						
						<p class="fragment">For both tasks, it is important that you make use of one or more <strong>theories from class</strong> to show that you can apply these theories independently and critically.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h2>Data and methods </h2>
						<p class="fragment">No specific methods required. </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">No expectations that you collect original data. </li>
							<li class="fragment">You can cite sources on your case if you have some (both first hand and secondary sources are welcome). </li>
							<li class="fragment">But if you are not able to find evidence about certain aspects of the cases, you are also allowed to make assumptions, as long as you state clearly that this is an assumption you have made. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The main point is that you show you can use concepts and apply theories from class. </li>
							<li class="fragment">When you refer to concepts or theories, cite the relevant readings from class. </li>
							<li class="fragment">It is not necesarry to cite additional academic literature, but can give extra points if you do. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Task 1: Explaining a political decision </h2>
						<h3 class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Overall task description: </h3>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Using one or more theories from class explain how (and why) your case became a reality (or how and why it never materialised). How did standard/rule/norm emerge and stabilise? How was the engineering project conceived and approved/rejected? </p>
						<p class="fragment">Some concrete questions for your inspiration that can help you answer this task (you do not have to answer every question, but choose which ones you find relevant for a coherent analysis): </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Which actors were involved in the process?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Which role did these actors play? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Which existing institutions mattered and how did they matter? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How would different theories of institutionalism explain the emergence of this regulation/project? Does your case support the assumptions about institutions in different theories?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Who promoted your case? Who supported it? Who opposed it? And why might they have done so? </li>
							<li class="fragment">When and how did the case appear on the political agenda? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Was the case the result of a feedback loop from a previous policy cycle? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Which phases did the case go through? (think of different phases in the policy cycle) And in which order? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Once the case was on the political agenda, which policy alternatives occurred? How did they occur? Who promoted them and did some policy alternatives dominate? Why was that the case? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How was a (final) decision (or decisions) made in your case? Who decided (parliament, local council, president or someone else?) and how did they do that? Why did they make the decision they did? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Task 2: Democracy and the role of citizens in engineering </h2>
						<h3 class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Overall task description: </h3>
						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Using concepts from class, explain how citizens influenced (or how citizen influence lacked in) your case. And use theories to discuss whether citizens should have (more or less) influence on your case and how that could be organised. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Some concrete questions for your inspiration that can help you answer this task (you do not have to answer every question, but choose which ones you find relevant for a coherent analysis): </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Who initiated the regulation/project? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Who are/were affected by the regulation/project? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Did citizens somehow engage with this project? Who engaged? How did they engage, and what effect did it have?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Were any initiatives planned to involve citizens and include their opinions in the decision-making process? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Who organised this citizen involvement? How did they organise it? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How and to what extent were citizens able to influence the process?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Were citizens involved in any particular phase of your case? Were they fx. involved in the agenda-setting, policy formation, and/or decision-making? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Which democratic arguments could there be for/against citizen influence in this regulation/project?</li>
							<li class="fragment">What would different theories of democracy say about the need for citizen engagement in your case?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Could citizens have been involved more and/or better in the case? How? </li>
							<li class="fragment">If you were to organise citizen engagement in your case, what would that look like? Who would you involve, how, and in which parts of the process?</li>
